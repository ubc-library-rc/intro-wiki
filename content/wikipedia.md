# Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia based on a model of openly editable content.
Edits occur in real-time and are written collaboratively by people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds. What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor.

## Five Pillars of Wikipedia
<img src="images/five-pillars-wikipedia.png" alt="Five Pillars of Wikipedia" width="800" height="auto">

As with other other forms of knowledge production such as scholarly journals, the development of articles on Wikipedia is a process of information production governed by established norms. These are developed (and enforced) by those involved with the information production community.

The 5 Pillars of Wikipedia:
* Pillar 1: Online Encyclopedia
  * Scholarly materials typically involve original research whereas encyclopedias summarize previously published information
* Pillar 2: Neutral point of view
* Pillar 3: Free content that anyone can edit
* Pillar 4: Community members are expected to treat each other with civility and respect
* Pillar 5: There are no firm rules - this means that the way things are done now is dynamic

### Neutrality
Representing fairly and proportionately all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic.

Avoid editorial bias which includes:
* Stating opinions as facts
* Stating seriously contested assertions as facts
* Stating facts as opinions
* Using judgmental language

### Reliable resources
Reliable sources for use are:
* Published by a third-party with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.
* May be academic and peer-reviewed
* May come from non-academic sources such as:
  * University-level textbooks
  * Books published by respected publishing houses
  * Magazines
  * Journals
  * Mainstream newspapers

### Consensus
Consensus on Wikipedia means:
* An iterative process of editing
* Compromise
* Discussion through talk pages

And consensus is assumed unless challenged.

Consensus on Wikipedia does not mean:
* Unanimity
* A majority vote
* Stasis

### Conflict of Interest
Wikipedia's Conflict of Interest policy is largely focused on preventing contributions by an individual about themselves, their family, their clients, employers, or others who may have a relationship with them.
